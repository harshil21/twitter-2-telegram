# twitter-telegram-bot
An inline telegram which fetches tweets from twitter to any chat.

Type [@anytweetbot](https://t.me/anytweetbot) in any chat to start searching.

### Inline mode usage:

1. Just search for a tweet in the text box and appropriate results will show up.

2. Search as `@username tweet` to get a tweet from a specific user.

3. Search as `@username` to get all recent tweets from that user.

4. Nothing. You'll get tweets about a random trend.


#### Current limitations:
- Twitter's search API (v1.1) doesn't allow searching tweets 7 days after they are posted (in the standard package).
- Original quoted tweet text is not shown.
- You tell me.
